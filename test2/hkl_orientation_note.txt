Memo: (hkl) orientation vs [h k l] direction

Summary
- The current rotation aligns the real-space direction v = h*a + k*b + l*c to +Z.
- This is correct for cubic/orthogonal cells (a,b,c are perpendicular).
- For a general (skewed) cell, the plane (hkl) normal is NOT parallel to (h,k,l) in real space.

Crystal-plane normal (general case)
- The true normal of plane (hkl) is a reciprocal-lattice vector:
  n ∝ h*a* + k*b* + l*c*
- a*, b*, c* are reciprocal basis vectors of the real-space cell.
- Only in orthogonal cells do a* || a, b* || b, c* || c.

Why it matters
- If the cell is non-orthogonal, aligning Cell*[h k l] to +Z will NOT make the (hkl) plane perpendicular to +Z.
- For correct (hkl) alignment in a general cell, compute the reciprocal lattice and align n to +Z.

If needed later
- Use reciprocal lattice:
  a* = (b x c) / (a · (b x c))
  b* = (c x a) / (a · (b x c))
  c* = (a x b) / (a · (b x c))
- Then n = h*a* + k*b* + l*c*, and rotate n to +Z.
